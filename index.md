Apparatus is a sandbox puzzle game for Android devices. Use your hammer to pin planks and wheels together to build anything you can imagine, connect your apparatus to motors and give them power using batteries.

The game comes with a set of puzzle levels where the objective is to build contraptions to get the blue marble into the basket. There is also the sandbox mode which allows you to build freely with the parts that the game gives you, and either build contraptions in the Apparatus level type or make your own puzzles in the Challenge level type.

Apparatus was developed by the Swedish indie game company [Bithack AB](https://bithack.se) and released in 2011 for Android devices. It received widespread critical acclaim and news coverage from Android news outlets and beyond, topped the list of both best selling and top rated game in Android Market at its peak, and was handpicked as "Editor's Choice" by Google for several months.

In late 2011 the development of a sequel to Apparatus was announced, Apparatus 2: Principia. It was later rebranded to just Principia and released on Android in late 2013, later releasing a Windows version in early 2014. In 2022 the source code to Principia was released to the community, allowing it to be further developed and live on as an open source project. For Apparatus players wanting to try out Principia, see the [Principia for Apparatus Players](https://principia-web.se/wiki/Principia_for_Apparatus_Players) page on the Principia Wiki.

This site serves as a fan website for Apparatus created by the Principia community, providing information about the game after it was taken down from Google Play and the official community site shut down in early 2018.
