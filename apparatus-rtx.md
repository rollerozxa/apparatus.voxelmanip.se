Back in early 2021, community member Dra g began modelling Apparatus models in Blender, using more photorealistic textures and lighting while still keeping the same general style of the game's models.

Gradually more objects were modelled, and the beginning of a scene started to come together.

The work began to be referred to as "Apparatus RTX", referring to Nvidia's RTX series of graphics cards and the real-time ray tracing technology they introduced for games.

## The actual renders
An initial render of a bunch of the object models placed together into a scene. It has a lot of bloom and noise.

The second render ended up being much better with less bloom and noise, and better lighting overall. as well as some cables connected to the objects.

**This will be Apparatus in 2019!**
