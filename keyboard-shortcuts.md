title: Keyboard Shortcuts
---

While Apparatus is primarily an Android game designed with touch controls in mind, the game has many keyboard shortcuts that can be used when playing with a physical or virtual keyboard available.

Most of these shortcuts were likely originally intended for using the desktop version of Apparatus during development, but they ended up in the released Android version as well. As such some of them may be strange or gamebreaking, such as the keybinds to spawn objects directly into the level.
