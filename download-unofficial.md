1.2.2 was an unofficial update developed by ROllerozxa by means of reverse engineering. The primary purpose of the update was to connect the game to the unofficial community site replacement apparatus-web. However apparatus-web has been shut down due to inactivity and the community site component is again no longer functional.

In addition to apparatus-web however, it had a number of other changes such as reverting to the classic music soundtrack and some classic sound effects, added the ability to use the Christmas themed background as well as red buckets in any level, disabling the "Adjusting graphics" check and disabling the bounds check.

The last beta version of 1.2.2, Beta 3, can be **[downloaded here](https://archive.org/download/apparatus-1.2.2/Apparatus_1.2.2_Beta3.apk)**. It no longer sees any updates.
