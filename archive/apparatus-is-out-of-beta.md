*We're happy to announce that Apparatus is finally out of beta.*

*Many bugs have been fixed since the initial release of the beta version, and even more features have been added.*

*Since the release of the first beta version, close to 100,000 people have bought the game on Android Market. Each day, there are around 4,000 active users in the community section. In total, 2,000 user-made levels have been uploaded to the community section, which is an impressive amount high above what we expected.*

*The Apparatus 1.0 update should be available any second now in the Market, depending on where in the world you are located. Please be patient until it arrives.*

## What the out-of-beta status means
From this point on we will dedicate more time on our upcoming games, but still maintain Apparatus by adding new levels now and then, and fixing possible bugs. We have some new features for Apparatus planned, but since the development will focus mainly on our new games, these features will be rolled out at a relatively slow pace compared to during the beta phase.
