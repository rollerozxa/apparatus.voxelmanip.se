title: Apparatus Decompilation

In early 2026 ROllerozxa begun work on a new decompilation project for Apparatus, reproducing the source code in a state where it can be rebuilt into a working game again, allowing for improvements to the game that were not possible before.

The Apparatus decompilation runs both on Android as well as on desktop platforms such as Windows and Linux. The Android version is functionally almost up to parity with the last official release, while the desktop version is missing functionality due to the lack of dialogs.

Currently there are no precompiled builds of the decompilation available, but you can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/rollerozxa/apparatus-decomp) and follow the build instructions in the README.
