## Unofficial
In addition to the last official Apparatus version 1.2.1, a new unofficial update to Apparatus was being worked on by ROllerozxa through reverse engineering the game. The primary purpose of it was to connect to the now defunct apparatus-web community site and no longer sees any updates made to it, but some of the additional changes may be preferred over 1.2.1.

## Official
The last official version of Apparatus was 1.2.1, released on the 17th January of 2014. It can be downloaded here:

### [Download Apparatus v1.2.1 (.apk)](https://archive.org/download/apparatus-android-game-archive/Apparatus_1.2.1.apk)
It requires Android 1.6+, and should work fine on way newer versions of Android assuming your device can still run 32-bit apps. The app also supports x86 devices, which includes most desktop Android emulators and other strange places where you may find Android running.

For a list of all versions of Apparatus, including older versions, see the [All Versions](/all-versions/) page. Also see the [Changelog](/changelog/) page for a version history of the game.

## Playing Apparatus in [CURRENT_YEAR]
Apparatus as a game is over a decade old at this point, and a lot has happened with Android since then. If you are using a modern phone from this decade, there may be some

First of all, Apparatus is a 32-bit app. Certain very recent 64-bit Android phones have begun to drop support for running 32-bit apps on the hardware level. Apparatus will not be able to run on these phones, which will only increase in amount in the coming years.

If you are playing Apparatus on Android 10 and above, the menu button in the navigation bar was permanently removed. Apparatus makes use of this menu button for various functionality, most specifically for opening a menu of options in the sandbox. You will need some kind of button remapper app, such as [Button Mapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.homebutton) in order to access this button again.

There are various graphical glitches that have come up under the years, but they should be relatively minor.
