Apparatus contains a soundtrack, the set of tracks varies by version but were all composed by Daniel "sapht" Hjerth.

The classic soundtrack contained the following three songs which would play in order on repeat, squashed together into the file "squashed.mp3" in the game's files:

- Limefrukt - [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sapht/apparatus-soundtrack-limefrukt)
- Vempunkt - [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sapht/apparatus-soundtrack-vempunkt)
- Valley (Not present in the LITE version) - [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sapht/apparatus-soundtrack-valley)

In the Christmas update (1.1) the classic soundtrack was replaced with one track, Joy of Apparatus ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sapht/joy-of-apparatus)). It is based on "Jesus, bliebet meine freude" from Bach's [BWV 147](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herz_und_Mund_und_Tat_und_Leben,_BWV_147).

The [unofficial 1.2.2 update](/download-unofficial/) reverts the soundtrack list to the classic soundtrack set of three tracks.
