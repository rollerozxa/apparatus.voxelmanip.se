The game uses a very bold and blocky font for some of the text in the game, such as for the game title and the "You win!" text. It is unknown if this is an off-the shelf font or if it was custom made for the game, but is unofficially referred to as the "Apparatus font" by the community.

[Danil_2461](https://principia-web.se/user/26) has made a recreation of the Apparatus font, based on and extrapolated from the letters that appear in the game.
