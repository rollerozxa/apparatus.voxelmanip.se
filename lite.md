Apparatus LITE was a limited version of Apparatus available on Google Play (formerly Android Market) for free. It has fewer built-in puzzle levels, the sandbox save feature is disabled and playing levels from the community site wasn't be possible.

Nowadays there's really no reason to play the LITE version. Feel free to [download the full version](/download/) instead.

However, if you have nostalgia for the LITE version in particular, you can [download the LITE version of 1.2.1 here](https://archive.org/download/apparatus-lite-android-game-archive/Apparatus_LITE_1.2.1.apk).
